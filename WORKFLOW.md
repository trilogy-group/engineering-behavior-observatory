You are working on a Linear ticket `{{ issue.identifier }}`

{% if attempt %}
Continuation context:

- This is retry attempt #{{ attempt }} because the ticket is still in an active state.
- Resume from the current workspace state instead of restarting from scratch.
- Do not repeat already-completed investigation or validation unless needed for new code changes.
- Do not end the turn while the issue remains in an active state unless you are blocked by missing required permissions/secrets.
  {% endif %}

Issue context:
Identifier: {{ issue.identifier }}
Title: {{ issue.title }}
Current status: {{ issue.state }}
Labels: {{ issue.labels }}
URL: {{ issue.url }}

Description:
{% if issue.description %}
{{ issue.description }}
{% else %}
No description provided.
{% endif %}

Instructions:

1. This is an unattended orchestration session. Never ask a human to perform follow-up actions.
2. Only stop early for a true blocker (missing required auth/permissions/secrets). If blocked, record it in the workpad and move the issue according to workflow.
3. Final message must report completed actions and blockers only. Do not include "next steps for user".

Work only in the provided repository copy. Do not touch any other path.

## Prerequisite: `LINEAR_API_KEY` is available

The agent must be able to talk to Linear through direct GraphQL using
`LINEAR_API_KEY` plus the repo-local `linear` skill assets. If the key is not
present, treat that as a real blocker and follow the blocked path in this
workflow.

## Default posture

- Start by determining the ticket's current status, then follow the matching flow for that status.
- Start every task by opening the tracking workpad comment and bringing it up to date before doing new implementation work.
- Spend extra effort up front on planning and verification design before implementation.
- Reproduce first: always confirm the current behavior/issue signal before changing code so the fix target is explicit.
- Keep ticket metadata current (state, checklist, acceptance criteria, links).
- Treat a single persistent Linear comment as the source of truth for progress.
- Use that single workpad comment for all progress and handoff notes; do not post separate "done"/summary comments.
- Treat any ticket-authored `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` section as non-negotiable acceptance input: mirror it in the workpad and execute it before considering the work complete.
- When meaningful out-of-scope improvements are discovered during execution,
  file a separate Linear issue instead of expanding scope. The follow-up issue
  must include a clear title, description, and acceptance criteria, be placed in
  `Backlog`, be assigned to the same project as the current issue, link the
  current issue as `related`, and use `blockedBy` when the follow-up depends on
  the current issue.
- Move status only when the matching quality bar is met.
- Operate autonomously end-to-end unless blocked by missing requirements, secrets, or permissions.
- Use the blocked-access escape hatch only for true external blockers (missing required tools/auth) after exhausting documented fallbacks.

## Related skills

- `linear`: interact with Linear.
- `commit`: produce clean, logical commits during implementation.
- `push`: keep remote branch current and publish updates.
- `pull`: keep branch updated with latest `origin/develop` before handoff.
- `land`: when ticket reaches `Merging`, explicitly open and follow `.agents/skills/land/SKILL.md`, which includes the `land` loop.

## Status map

- `Backlog` -> out of scope for this workflow; do not modify.
- `Todo` -> queued; immediately transition to `In Progress` before active work.
  - Special case: if a PR is already attached, treat as feedback/rework loop (run full PR feedback sweep, address or explicitly push back, revalidate, return to `Human Review`).
- `In Progress` -> implementation actively underway.
- `Human Review` -> PR is attached and validated; waiting on human approval.
- `Merging` -> approved by human; execute the `land` skill flow (do not call `gh pr merge` directly).
- `Rework` -> reviewer requested changes; planning + implementation required.
- `Done` -> terminal state; no further action required.

## Step 0: Determine current ticket state and route

1. Fetch the issue by explicit ticket ID.
2. Read the current state.
3. Route to the matching flow:
   - `Backlog` -> do not modify issue content/state; stop and wait for human to move it to `Todo`.
   - `Todo` -> immediately move to `In Progress`, then ensure bootstrap workpad comment exists (create if missing), then start execution flow.
     - If PR is already attached, start by reviewing the latest Linear issue comments and all open PR comments, then decide required changes vs explicit pushback responses.
   - `In Progress` -> continue execution flow from current scratchpad comment.
   - `Human Review` -> wait and poll for decision/review updates.
   - `Merging` -> on entry, open and follow `.agents/skills/land/SKILL.md`; do not call `gh pr merge` directly.
   - `Rework` -> run rework flow.
   - `Done` -> do nothing and shut down.
4. Check whether a PR already exists for the current branch and whether it is closed.
   - For `Todo`, `In Progress`, or `Rework`: if a branch PR exists and is `CLOSED` or `MERGED`, treat prior branch work as non-reusable for this run.
   - For `Todo`, `In Progress`, or `Rework`: create a fresh branch from `origin/develop` and restart execution flow as a new attempt.
   - For `Human Review` or `Merging`: if the attached PR is already `MERGED`, do **not** reset the branch; update the workpad/dashboard as needed and move the issue to `Done`.
5. For `Todo` tickets, do startup sequencing in this exact order:
   - `update_issue(..., state: "In Progress")`
   - find/create `## Agent Harness Workpad` bootstrap comment
   - only then begin analysis/planning/implementation work.
6. Add a short comment if state and issue content are inconsistent, then proceed with the safest flow.

## Step 1: Start/continue execution (Todo or In Progress)

1.  Find or create a single persistent scratchpad comment for the issue:
    - Search existing comments for a marker header: `## Agent Harness Workpad`.
    - Ignore resolved comments while searching; only active/unresolved comments are eligible to be reused as the live workpad.
    - If found, reuse that comment; do not create a new workpad comment.
    - If not found, create one workpad comment and use it for all updates.
    - Persist the workpad comment ID and only write progress updates to that ID.
2.  If arriving from `Todo`, do not delay on additional status transitions: the issue should already be `In Progress` before this step begins.
3.  Immediately reconcile the workpad before new edits:
    - Check off items that are already done.
    - Expand/fix the plan so it is comprehensive for current scope.
    - Ensure `Acceptance Criteria` and `Validation` are current and still make sense for the task.
4.  Before planning implementation details, load pre-implementation memory context with `opensymphony memory context --issue {{ issue.identifier }}` when memory is configured, and treat the result as advisory context.
5.  Start work by writing/updating a hierarchical plan in the workpad comment.
6.  Ensure the workpad includes a compact environment stamp at the top as a code fence line:
    - Format: `<host>:<abs-workdir>@<short-sha>`
    - Example: `devbox-01:/home/dev-user/code/symphony-workspaces/MT-32@7bdde33bc`
    - Do not include metadata already inferable from Linear issue fields (`issue ID`, `status`, `branch`, `PR link`).
7.  Add explicit acceptance criteria and TODOs in checklist form in the same comment.
    - If changes are user-facing, include a UI walkthrough acceptance criterion that describes the end-to-end user path to validate.
    - If changes touch app files or app behavior, add explicit app-specific flow checks to `Acceptance Criteria` in the workpad (for example: launch path, changed interaction path, and expected result path).
    - If the ticket description/comment context includes `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` sections, copy those requirements into the workpad `Acceptance Criteria` and `Validation` sections as required checkboxes (no optional downgrade).
8.  Run a principal-style self-review of the plan and refine it in the comment.
9.  Before implementing, capture a concrete reproduction signal and record it in the workpad `Notes` section (command/output, screenshot, or deterministic UI behavior).
10. After initial file discovery, re-run `opensymphony memory context --issue {{ issue.identifier }} --paths <path1>,<path2> --include-code-intel` for touched areas when memory is configured, record useful references in the workpad, and treat current source files and tests as authoritative over generated context.
11. Run the `pull` skill to sync with latest `origin/develop` before any code edits, then record the pull/sync result in the workpad `Notes`.
    - Include a `pull skill evidence` note with:
      - merge source(s),
      - result (`clean` or `conflicts resolved`),
      - resulting `HEAD` short SHA.
12. Compact context and proceed to execution.

## Branch target

Target branch: `develop`

<!-- Set by `opensymphony init` or `opensymphony update --target-branch`.
     Value is a local branch name, not an `origin/...` ref. Agents should use
     `origin/<target-branch>` when syncing, creating replacement branches, and
     preparing PRs. -->

## Automated AI PR review

Active review provider: `codex`

<!-- Set by `opensymphony init`; valid values: `openhands`, `codex`, `none`.
     openhands = OpenHands PR Review plugin via GitHub Actions (pay-per-token,
                 uses the AI_REVIEW_API_KEY repository secret).
     codex     = Codex code review via the Codex GitHub integration (included
                 with a ChatGPT subscription; GitHub-triggered reviews draw
                 from a separate code-review usage pool, so they never compete
                 with implementation runs for quota).
     To switch providers later, edit the value above and follow
     https://github.com/kumanday/OpenSymphony/blob/main/docs/codex-code-review-setup.md -->

Both providers post standard GitHub reviews with inline comments. Every PR gets
exactly three completed full-PR scans when a provider is active: the automatic
scan at PR creation, then two explicit re-triggers. Treat findings from either
provider identically under the PR feedback sweep protocol below.

Track the three scans in the single workpad with scan number, reviewed head SHA,
status, and finding resolution. A full scan reviews the entire current PR, not
only the commits since the prior scan. Do not request scan 2 or 3 while the
previous scan is still running, and do not request a fourth automated scan.
An exact-commit local review is read-only and covers only the named commit
against its parent or parents; record its command and result in the workpad and
do not post another automated-review trigger.

Whenever this workflow says "re-trigger AI review", perform the action that
matches the active provider:

- `openhands`: remove any existing `review-this` label, then add it again so the
  label event starts one new scan (`gh pr edit <pr> --remove-label review-this`
  followed by `gh pr edit <pr> --add-label review-this`). Ignore a missing-label
  error on removal.
- `codex`: post a top-level PR comment whose entire body is exactly
  `@codex review` (`gh pr comment <pr> --body '@codex review'`). Codex reacts
  with 👀 and posts a fresh full review.
- `none`: skip re-trigger steps; only human and CI feedback apply.

Never re-trigger at PR creation time for either provider: the initial review
runs automatically when the PR is opened (`pull_request.opened` for
`openhands`, automatic reviews for `codex`).

Codex guardrails (mandatory whenever the active provider is `codex`):

- The re-trigger phrase must be exactly `@codex review` with no other text.
  Mentioning `@codex` with anything else starts a cloud task outside this
  review workflow and is prohibited.
- Never ask Codex to fix, implement, or push changes. All code changes happen
  in this orchestrated workspace through the normal implementation flow; the
  review bot only reviews.

AI review comments are posted by `github-actions[bot]` (openhands, job name
`openhands-review`) or by the Codex connector bot (`chatgpt-codex-connector`).
Treat both as actionable AI feedback in the sweep protocol.

## PR feedback sweep protocol (required)

When a ticket has an attached PR, run this protocol before moving to `Human Review`:

1. Identify the PR number from issue links/attachments.
2. Gather feedback from all channels:
   - Latest Linear issue comments (`.agents/skills/linear/queries/issue_comments.graphql`).
   - Top-level PR comments (`gh pr view --comments`).
   - Inline review comments (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr>/comments`).
   - Review summaries/states (`gh pr view --json reviews`).
3. Treat every P0/P1 feedback item and any P2 that demonstrates an acceptance-criteria failure, evidence loss or corruption, secret leakage, or a stated trust-boundary violation as blocking until one of these is true:
   - code/test/docs updated to address it, or
   - explicit, justified pushback is recorded in the originating feedback channel.
4. **Respond to inline review comments IN THE SAME THREAD** (required):
   - Use the explicit review-comment reply endpoint. Do not use top-level PR
     comments, issue comments, or the repository-wide `/pulls/comments`
     endpoint for inline replies.
   - Reply to the top-level review comment ID. If the comment you are looking
     at has `in_reply_to_id`, use that parent ID; GitHub does not support
     replies to replies.
   - Use the numeric `id` from `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr>/comments`,
     not the GraphQL `node_id` (`PRRC_...`) and not a discussion URL fragment.
   - Send the body as JSON via stdin to avoid shell quoting and `gh api` field
     conversion surprises:
     ```bash
     jq -nc --arg body "Fixed in <commit-sha>: <brief description of change>" \
       '{body:$body}' |
       gh api -X POST \
         /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr>/comments/<top_level_review_comment_id>/replies \
         --input -
     ```
   - Verify the reply landed in the intended thread before marking the feedback
     item resolved:
     ```bash
     gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr>/comments --paginate \
       --jq '.[] | select(.in_reply_to_id == <top_level_review_comment_id>) | {id, body, html_url}'
     ```
   - Do NOT post new top-level comments or workpad updates to describe what was changed for a specific review item.
   - Each inline review thread must have your response directly in that conversation.
   - After making code changes, reply in the thread: "Fixed in <commit-sha>: <brief description of change>" or "Pushback: <justification for not making the requested change>".
   - The goal is for the reviewer to see your response in context and easily track resolution status.
5. Update the workpad plan/checklist to include each feedback item and its resolution status.
6. For the current scan, batch accepted findings into one remediation push,
   re-run validation, reply in the originating threads, and wait for checks.
   Do not request a review merely because a push occurred.
7. Record explicit pushback for non-blocking or out-of-scope P2 findings; do not expand the issue to satisfy them.
8. Record the completed scan and reviewed head SHA in the workpad review ledger.
9. If fewer than three full scans have completed, re-trigger one full review
   using `Automated AI PR review`, even when the current scan is clean, then
   repeat this sweep for the new scan.
   - Do **not** re-trigger at PR creation; the automatic review is scan 1.
   - Never have more than one requested scan running at a time.
10. After scan 3, do not request another automated review. If scan 3 produces
    accepted fixes, batch and validate them once, then run an exact-commit local
    review of those final remediation commits. Address valid blocking findings
    locally and repeat exact-commit review as needed; never start scan 4.

## Blocked-access escape hatch (required behavior)

Use this only when completion is blocked by missing required tools or missing auth/permissions that cannot be resolved in-session.

- GitHub is **not** a valid blocker by default. Always try fallback strategies first (alternate remote/auth mode, then continue publish/review flow).
- Do not move to `Human Review` for GitHub access/auth until all fallback strategies have been attempted and documented in the workpad.
- If a non-GitHub required tool is missing, or required non-GitHub auth is unavailable, move the ticket to `Human Review` with a short blocker brief in the workpad that includes:
  - what is missing,
  - why it blocks required acceptance/validation,
  - exact human action needed to unblock.
- Keep the brief concise and action-oriented; do not add extra top-level comments outside the workpad.

## Step 2: Execution phase (Todo -> In Progress -> Human Review)

1.  Determine current repo state (`branch`, `git status`, `HEAD`) and verify the kickoff `pull` sync result is already recorded in the workpad before implementation continues.
2.  If current issue state is `Todo`, move it to `In Progress`; otherwise leave the current state unchanged.
3.  Load the existing workpad comment and treat it as the active execution checklist.
    - Edit it liberally whenever reality changes (scope, risks, validation approach, discovered tasks).
4.  Implement against the hierarchical TODOs and keep the comment current:
    - Check off completed items.
    - Add newly discovered items in the appropriate section.
    - Keep parent/child structure intact as scope evolves.
    - Update the workpad immediately after each meaningful milestone (for example: reproduction complete, code change landed, validation run, review feedback addressed).
    - Never leave completed work unchecked in the plan.
    - For tickets that started as `Todo` with an attached PR, run the full PR feedback sweep protocol immediately after kickoff and before new feature work.
5.  Run validation/tests required for the scope.
    - Mandatory gate: execute all ticket-provided `Validation`/`Test Plan`/ `Testing` requirements when present; treat unmet items as incomplete work.
    - Prefer a targeted proof that directly demonstrates the behavior you changed.
    - You may make temporary local proof edits to validate assumptions (for example: tweak a local build input for `make`, or hardcode a UI account / response path) when this increases confidence.
    - Revert every temporary proof edit before commit/push.
    - Document these temporary proof steps and outcomes in the workpad `Validation`/`Notes` sections so reviewers can follow the evidence.
6.  Re-check all acceptance criteria and close any gaps.
7.  Before every `git push` attempt, run the required validation for your scope and confirm it passes; if it fails, address issues and rerun until green, then commit and push changes.
8.  Attach the PR URL to the Linear issue through the repo-local `linear` skill using `attachmentLinkGitHubPR` (preferred) or `attachmentLinkURL` when the target is not a GitHub PR. This is REQUIRED - do not rely on mentioning the PR URL in comments alone. The PR must appear in the issue's Links/Attachments section.
    - Ensure the GitHub PR has label `symphony` (add it if missing).
    - Do **not** re-trigger AI review when this push created the PR; the PR open already triggered the initial review.
    - A branch update does not itself request a review. Follow the three-scan
      ledger in the PR feedback sweep protocol.
9.  Merge latest `origin/develop` into branch, resolve conflicts, and rerun checks.
10. Update the workpad comment with final checklist status and validation notes.
    - Mark completed plan/acceptance/validation checklist items as checked.
    - Add final handoff notes (commit + validation summary) in the same workpad comment.
    - Do not include PR URL in the workpad comment; keep PR linkage on the issue via attachment/link fields.
    - Add a short `### Confusions` section at the bottom when any part of task execution was unclear/confusing, with concise bullets.
    - Do not post any additional completion summary comment.
11. Before moving to `Human Review`, poll PR feedback and checks:
    - Read the PR `Manual QA Plan` comment (when present) and use it to sharpen UI/runtime test coverage for the current change.
    - Run the full PR feedback sweep protocol.
    - Confirm PR checks are passing (green) after the latest changes.
    - Confirm every required ticket-provided validation/test-plan item is explicitly marked complete in the workpad.
    - Complete all three full automated scans when a provider is active. Repeat
      the bounded check-address-verify loop until no outstanding comments remain
      and checks are fully passing.
    - Re-open and refresh the workpad before state transition so `Plan`, `Acceptance Criteria`, and `Validation` exactly match completed work.
12. Only then move issue to `Human Review`.
    - Exception: if blocked by missing required non-GitHub tools/auth per the blocked-access escape hatch, move to `Human Review` with the blocker brief and explicit unblock actions.
13. For `Todo` tickets that already had a PR attached at kickoff:
    - Ensure all existing PR feedback was reviewed and resolved, including inline review comments (code changes or explicit, justified pushback response).
    - Ensure branch was pushed with any required updates.
    - Then move to `Human Review`.

## Step 3: Human Review and merge handling

1. When the issue is in `Human Review`, do not code or change ticket content.
2. On every `Human Review` poll cycle, fetch feedback in this order before doing anything else:
   - latest Linear issue comments
   - top-level PR comments (`gh pr view --comments`)
   - inline PR review comments (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr>/comments`)
   - PR review summaries/states (`gh pr view --json reviews,reviewDecision`)
   - PR check state (`gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup`)
3. Poll silently by default while the issue remains in `Human Review`.
   - Do not add a new Linear comment.
   - Do not rewrite the workpad comment just because a poll happened, the retry counter increased, or the PR is still waiting on the same human decision.
   - Only update the single workpad comment when something materially changes: new actionable feedback arrives, approval/review/check/mergeability state changes, the ticket leaves `Human Review`, or you need a one-time escalation after an unusually long stall.
4. Treat all human feedback channels as authoritative, not just inline review comments:
   - a new Linear issue comment from the operator is actionable feedback
   - a new top-level PR comment is actionable feedback
   - a failing required PR check is actionable feedback even if no human comment was left
5. If any actionable feedback or failing required check is present, move the issue to `Rework` and follow the rework flow.
   - The three automated scans are already complete before `Human Review`.
     Review code changes made after that point with exact-commit local review;
     do not start a fourth automated scan.
   - Do not wait for an inline review comment when a Linear comment, top-level PR comment, or failing check already requires action.
6. If approved, human moves the issue to `Merging`.
7. When the issue is in `Merging`, first inspect the attached PR state.
   - If the PR is already `MERGED`, update the workpad/dashboard and move the issue directly to `Done`.
   - If the PR is still open, re-run the PR feedback sweep protocol one final time. Do not proceed if:
   - Any critical/major feedback remains unaddressed (no code change or pushback reply)
   - Required checks are failing
   - Required validation items from the ticket are incomplete
   Wait for the human to move the issue to `Merging` only when genuinely ready.
8. If the PR is still open, open and follow `.agents/skills/land/SKILL.md` to perform the repo-specific final merge-readiness checks and handoff. Do not call `gh pr merge` directly.
9. Continue polling while the issue remains in `Merging`. As soon as the attached PR is observed in `MERGED` state, move the issue to `Done`.

## Step 4: Rework handling

When an issue moves to `Rework`, first determine the scope of required changes:

### Minor feedback / incremental changes (typical case)

For most code review feedback (addressing comments, small fixes, requested tweaks):

1. **Keep the existing PR and branch open** - do not close them.
2. Continue using the existing `## Agent Harness Workpad` comment - do not remove it.
3. Address each piece of feedback directly in the current branch:
    - Make the requested code changes
    - Read and address the latest Linear issue comments before GitHub review threads so operator guidance is not missed
    - Read and address top-level PR comments in addition to inline review comments
    - Reply directly in every inline review thread with the resolution (`Fixed in <commit-sha>: ...`) or explicit pushback justification
    - Push new commits to the same branch
4. Update the workpad with:
   - List of feedback items addressed
   - Any items pushed back with justification
   - Validation steps re-run
5. Re-run validation/tests to ensure changes are correct.
   - Always inspect current PR checks (`gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup`) before declaring feedback addressed.
   - If any required check is failing, treat that as unfinished rework even if the latest review text is positive.
6. After pushing follow-up commits, consult the workpad review ledger. Request
   the next full scan only when fewer than three scans have completed. Once all
   three are complete, use exact-commit local review and never request scan 4.
7. Move the issue back to `Human Review` once all feedback is addressed.

**Preserve review history**: Keeping the same PR preserves all discussion context, review threads, and decision history. Reviewers can see incremental changes rather than starting from scratch.

### Major rework / complete reset (rare case)

Only close the PR and start fresh when:
- The entire approach is fundamentally flawed and needs redesign
- The branch has become unrecoverable (severe merge conflicts, corrupted history)
- The scope has changed so dramatically that the existing PR is irrelevant

For major rework:

1. Document in the workpad **why** a reset is necessary before closing anything.
2. Close the existing PR tied to the issue.
3. Remove the existing `## Agent Harness Workpad` comment from the issue.
4. Create a fresh branch from `origin/develop`.
5. Start over from the normal kickoff flow:
   - If current issue state is `Todo`, move it to `In Progress`; otherwise keep the current state.
   - Create a new bootstrap `## Agent Harness Workpad` comment.
   - Build a fresh plan/checklist and execute end-to-end.
6. Do **not** re-trigger AI review immediately after creating the new PR; the initial PR open already triggered the automated review.

**Default assumption**: Treat `Rework` as minor feedback unless there is clear evidence that the approach is fundamentally broken. Preserve PR history and discussion context as the default behavior.

## Completion bar before Human Review

- Step 1/2 checklist is fully complete and accurately reflected in the single workpad comment.
- Acceptance criteria and required ticket-provided validation items are complete.
- Validation/tests are green for the latest commit.
- When an automated provider is active, the workpad records exactly three
  completed full-PR scans and all their findings are resolved or explicitly
  pushed back in the originating thread.
- PR feedback sweep is complete and no actionable comments remain.
- PR checks are green, branch is pushed, and PR is linked on the issue.
- Required PR metadata is present (`symphony` label).

## Guardrails

- If the branch PR is already closed/merged, do not reuse that branch or prior implementation state for continuation.
- For closed/merged branch PRs, create a new branch from `origin/develop` and restart from reproduction/planning as if starting fresh.
- **Do not close an open PR for minor feedback or incremental changes** - address feedback in the same branch/PR to preserve review history and discussion context.
- Only close a PR and start fresh for major rework (fundamentally flawed approach, unrecoverable branch, or completely changed scope).
- If issue state is `Backlog`, do not modify it; wait for human to move it to `Todo`.
- Do not edit the issue body/description for planning or progress tracking.
- Use exactly one persistent workpad comment (`## Agent Harness Workpad`) per issue.
- If comment editing fails, use the repo-local `linear` helper with `queries/comment_update.graphql` before reporting a blocker.
- Temporary proof edits are allowed only for local verification and must be reverted before commit.
- If out-of-scope improvements are found, create a separate Backlog issue rather
  than expanding current scope, and include a clear
  title/description/acceptance criteria, same-project assignment, a `related`
  link to the current issue, and `blockedBy` when the follow-up depends on
  the current issue.
- Shared guidance documents (`.agents/skills/custom-codereview-guide.md`, `AGENTS.md`, this file) are durable and task-agnostic. Never write PR-specific or ticket-specific content into them — no "already resolved, do not re-flag" lists, no per-PR evidence dumps. Respond to review feedback in the PR's review threads; only add guidance that applies to all future work.
- Never mention `@codex` in any comment except the exact re-trigger phrase `@codex review`, and only when the active review provider is `codex`.
- Never exceed three completed automated full-PR scans for one PR. After scan 3,
  review later remediation or merge-conflict commits locally by exact commit.
- Never ask a review bot (Codex or OpenHands) to implement, fix, or push changes; implement all fixes in this workspace through the normal flow.
- Do not move to `Human Review` unless the `Completion bar before Human Review` is satisfied.
- **Never merge or allow merge of a PR with outstanding critical feedback or failing checks.** This includes not moving to `Merging` if feedback sweep shows unresolved comments.
- In `Human Review`, do not make changes; wait and poll.
- If state is terminal (`Done`), do nothing and shut down.
- Keep issue text concise, specific, and reviewer-oriented.
- If blocked and no workpad exists yet, add one blocker comment describing blocker, impact, and next unblock action.

## Dependency Blocker Dashboard Maintenance

This workflow manages multiple concurrent issues with complex dependencies. To help human reviewers prioritize which PRs to review first, agents must maintain a **Dependency Blockers & PR Review Priority** table in the Linear project description.

The Linear project overview is a live dashboard, not a one-off narrative summary. The project description must always begin with the `## Dependency Blockers & PR Review Priority` section, and that section must be regenerated in place whenever the underlying review queue changes.

### When to update the dashboard

Update the priority table in the Linear project overview whenever:
- An issue moves to/from `Human Review` or `Merging` (has a pending PR)
- An issue's blocking relationships change (blockedBy links added/removed)
- An issue is completed (status becomes Done/Closed/Cancelled)
- An issue is discovered to be on the critical path (unblocks many downstream issues)

### How to update the dashboard

1. Use the repo-local Linear helper with `queries/project_by_slug.graphql` to
   fetch the current project description
2. Locate the `## Dependency Blockers & PR Review Priority` section
   - If it does not exist, create it at the very top of the project description.
   - If the top of the description contains a stale narrative overview or milestone dump, replace that top section with the live dashboard and keep any still-useful static planning notes below it.
3. Regenerate the table with current data:
   - Query all issues in `Human Review`, `Merging`, `Rework`, `In Progress`, and `Todo` states
   - Include `includeRelations: true` to get blockedBy/blocks data
   - Map each issue's attachments to find PR links
4. Prioritize using this algorithm:
   - **P0 (🔴 Critical):** Issues that are unblocked AND block the most downstream work (highest impact)
   - **P1 (🟡 Epic):** Parent issues of active milestones that need review
   - **P2 (🟢 Ready):** Issues unblocked but with lower downstream impact
   - **P3 (⚪ Waiting):** Issues currently blocked by dependencies
5. Use the repo-local Linear helper with
   `queries/project_update_content.graphql` to update the description with the
   new table
6. Do not append ad hoc prose summaries above the dashboard. Keep the dashboard concise, current, and reviewer-focused.

### Priority calculation guidelines

For each issue with a pending PR, score it by:
1. **Is it unblocked?** (no open blockers in non-terminal states) → Higher priority
2. **How many issues does it block?** (count blocks relationships) → More = higher priority
3. **Is it a parent issue?** (has child issues grouped under it) → These should generally be P1 minimum
4. **Is it in the critical path?** (e.g., issue chain A → B → C) → P0

### Table format

Use this exact markdown structure (no Status column - Linear issue refs automatically show status):

```markdown
## Dependency Blockers & PR Review Priority

| Priority | Issue | PR | Blocked By | Blocks | Impact |
|:--------:|:------|:--:|:-----------|:-------|:-------|
| 🔴 **P0** | [XXX](<https://linear.app/your-team/issue/XXX>) | [#N](<https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/pull/N>) | Blockers | Count | Brief description |
| 🟡 **P1** | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 🟢 **P2** | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| ⚪ **P3** | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Legend:** 🔴 Critical path | 🟡 Parent issue | 🟢 Ready but lower priority | ⚪ Waiting on dependencies

**Immediate Action:** [One-line summary of what to review first]
```

### Workpad template

Use this exact structure for the persistent workpad comment and keep it updated in place throughout execution:

```md
## Agent Harness Workpad

```text
<hostname>:<abs-path>@<short-sha>
```

### Plan

- [ ] 1. Parent task
  - [ ] 1.1 Child task
  - [ ] 1.2 Child task
- [ ] 2. Parent task

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

### Validation

- [ ] targeted tests: `<command>`

### Notes

Timestamped audit log. Add an entry after every milestone (state change, reproduction captured, code change, validation run, PR event, review addressed). Use ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ: <action>`.

- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ: State transition: Todo → In Progress, created workpad
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ: Pull skill: merged origin/develop clean, HEAD now <short-sha>
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ: Reproduction captured: <command or behavior observed>
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ: Validation passed: <test command and result>
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ: Committed <short-sha>: <commit message summary>
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ: PR #N opened, awaiting checks

### Confusions
